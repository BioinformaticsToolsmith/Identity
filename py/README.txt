Purpose 

This program performs hierarchical clustering using all-versus-all identity scores produced by Identity.

Requirements 

Python 3 with SciPy and Matplotlib packages.

Examples

1. Display only sorted leaves to the terminal, i.e. no graphics: 
	python3 makeTree.py all_vs_all_identity_scores 0

2. Display tree:
	python3 makeTree.py all_vs_all_identity_scores 1

Note

The hierarchical clustering algorithm may take long time.
